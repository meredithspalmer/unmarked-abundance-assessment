## Abstract 
Camera trap surveys are a globally-popular wildlife monitoring technique. Animals lacking individual recognition, such as many large herbivore species, are a common focus of camera trap studies, but the applicability of common abundance analyses to these types of animals is poorly understood. Here, we compare the equivalency, precision, and reliability of density estimates from random encounter models, N-mixture models, and unmarked spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to aerial survey estimates for seven large herbivore species. These models require only basic camera trap data and parameters (e.g., such as would be generated by citizen science or machine learning). We calculated densities from our entire dataset and spatial and temporal subsets that were disaggregated to reduce bias. Relative to aerial surveys, SECR models and REMs generated the most equivalent and precise estimates for six and five of seven species, respectively, from at least one data subset. Within several subsets, both approaches generated strong 1:1 relationships between derived and aerial density estimates. N-mixture models produced comparable density estimates for only a single species. REMs and SECR models performed best on species with larger home-ranges, and REMs additionally worked better on smaller-bodied herbivores. We demonstrate that practitioners can produce reasonable estimates of unmarked herbivore densities with accessible REM and SECR models and basic camera trap data. To improve accessibility of these methods to a broad audience of practitioners, we include a non-technical introduction to each technique and discuss the advantages and limitations of these methods in camera trap studies.
