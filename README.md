Code for JAE submission: "An overview and validation of statistical techniques to estimate abundance of unmarked animals from camera trap data"

## Abstract 
Camera trap surveys are a globally-popular wildlife monitoring technique. Animals lacking individual recognition, such as many large herbivore species, are a common focus of camera trap studies, but the applicability of common abundance analyses to these types of animals is poorly understood. Here, we compare the equivalency, precision, and reliability of density estimates from random encounter models (REMs), N-mixture models, and unmarked spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models to aerial survey estimates for seven large herbivore species. These models require only basic camera trap data and parameters (e.g., such as would be generated rapidly by citizen science or machine learning). We calculated densities from our entire dataset and spatial and temporal subsets that were disaggregated to reduce bias. Relative to aerial surveys, all models generated density estimates that overlapped with the aerial estimates, although those produced by SECR models and REMs were the most equivalent and precise. Within several subsets, both of these approaches generated strong 1:1 relationships between derived and aerial density estimates. N-mixture models produced estimates with large confidence intervals, rendering them less useful for practitioners. Each model performed differently relative to species with different traits, such as body, group, and home range-size. Disaggregating data into time periods or habitats in which animal behavior better fit model assumptions improved model estimates relative to using all available data. We demonstrate that practitioners can produce reasonable estimates of unmarked herbivore densities with accessible SECR and REM models and basic camera trap data. To improve accessibility of these methods to a broad audience of practitioners, we include a non-technical introduction to each technique and discuss the advantages and limitations of these methods in camera trap studies.
