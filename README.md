Code for Int. Zool. paper: "An overview and validation of statistical techniques to estimate abundance of unmarked animals from camera trap data"

## Abstract 
Estimating abundance is critical for the management and conservation of wildlife populations. While there is a well-developed field of analytics using camera trap data to calculate densities for individually identifiable animals, current methods for unmarked animals have received few rigorous validations. Here, we review three such statistical techniques and compare the accuracy, precision, and reliability of camera trap density estimates from random encounter models (REMs), N-mixture models, and unmarked extensions of spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models to aerial survey data for seven large African herbivores species. We calculated estimates using our entire dataset as well as spatial and temporal subsets of the data anticipated to reduce model bias (woodlands, open plains, daytime, and nighttime data). Compared to the independently-derived density values, REMs generated the most accurate and precise estimates for all species using at least one data subset, followed by SECR models (all species except buffalo). The reliability of both metrics across species was strongly isometric within several data subsets. N-mixture models performed poorly across all animals and subsets, producing comparable density estimates for only two species. While there is no obvious pattern as to why particular data subsets generated better estimates for particular models or particular species, REMs performed best on smaller species with larger home-ranges while N-Mixture and SECR models produced more comparable estimates for species with smaller home-range areas. We provide a non-technical description of the assumptions and application of each method and discuss the usefulness of these frameworks for wildlife researchers and managers.
