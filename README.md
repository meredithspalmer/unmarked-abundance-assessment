Code for J. Appl. Ecol. paper: "An overview and validation of statistical techniques to estimate abundance of unmarked animals from camera trap data"

## Abstract 
1.	Estimating abundance is critical in the study of wildlife populations. Camera trap surveys have become a globally-popular wildlife monitoring technique and the application of citizen science and artificial intelligence is allowing for images from these surveys to be classified at a rate fast enough for use in adaptive management and conservation. However, few methods exist to use such data for calculating densities of animals lacking individual recognition. ‘Unmarked’ large herbivores are a common focus of camera trap studies, but the applicability of abundance analyses to these types of animals is poorly understood. 
2.	Here, we compare the equivalency, precision, and reliability of camera trap density estimates from three models that require only basic camera trap data and parameters - random encounter models, N-mixture models, and unmarked spatially-explicit capture-recapture models - to aerial survey estimates for seven African herbivore species. We calculated densities from our entire dataset and spatial and temporal subsets that were disaggregated to reduce bias. 
3.	Relative to aerial surveys, SECR models and REMs generated the most equivalent and precise estimates for six and five of seven species, respectively, using at least one data subset. Within several subsets, both approaches generated strong 1:1 relationships between derived and aerial densities across the seven species. N-mixture models were the least successful, producing equivalent density estimates for only one species. 
4.	REMs performed best on smaller species with larger home-ranges while SECR models produced more comparable estimates for species with larger home-ranges. 
5.	Synthesis and applications: To improve accessibility of these methods to a broad conservation and management audience, we include a non-technical introduction to each technique and discuss how practitioners can maximize management inference from camera trap studies.
